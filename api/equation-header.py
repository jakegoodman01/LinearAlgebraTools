# LinearEquation(loc, rhs):
#    A LinearEquation contains the coefficients and RHS of a linear equation
#    LinearEquation: a[1]x1 + a[2]x2 + ... a[n]xn = rhs
#    :param loc: the list of coefficients
#    :param rhs: the right-hand-side of the equation
#
#  FIELDS:
#   * a: a[i] is the coefficient of x sub i
#        a[0] is None
#   * n: number of coefficients
#   * rhs: the right-hand-side of the equation
#
#  METHODS:
#   *
#


# LinearSystem(*args):
#    A LinearSystem contains multiple LinearEquations
#    :param args: args is a list of LinearEquations
#
#  FIELDS:
#   * e: e[i] represents equation i, of the linear system of equations
#        e[0] is None
#   * m: m is the number of equations in the system
#   * n: is the number of unknowns in each equation

# solves_equation(le, v) produces true if v is a solution to the LinearEquation

# solves_system(ls, v) produces true if v is a solution to the LinearSystem
