# Matrix(ls):
#    A Matrix emulates the interface of a matrix, which is really just a linear system of equations
#    :param ls: the LinearSystem representation of the matrix
#
#  FIELDS:
#   * ls: the LinearSystem representation of the matrix
#   * augmented: true means this is an augmented matrix, false otherwise
#   * m: number of rows
#   * n: number of columns
#
#  METHODS:
#   * copy() produces a copy of self
#   * sub(i, j) produces the the value at coordinates (i,j) of the matrix
#
#
# create_matrix(grid) produces a matrix with the coordinates given in grid (2d-array)
